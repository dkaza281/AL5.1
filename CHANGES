		compatible.
*	NEW TOOL: timetool
*	SHARED MEMORY IMPLEMENTATION REMOVED
		icam, cuesheet, aardvark, hview no longer exist
*	NEW TOOL: chant (replaces cuesheet, aardvark, hview)
	added ri-read-archive (used to inclue RIB files inside a RIB file)
*	new gops: display-gprims, render-gprims
*	new gprims: points, curves (supports new PRMan primitives)
*	ogre: support for points & curves gprims
	prman: support for normal, vector, matrix, array shader params
		in query-shader and auto shader declarations
	query-shader now displays parameter type information
	glw plugin (OpenGL widget): 
		data passed to callbacks for input, expose, and
		resize events has changed from the form (reason event-data)
		to (reasons (event-data) width height).
	utilities to compute polygon normals 
		(points-polys-n points polys) -> face normals
		(points-polys-avn points polys) -> average vertex normals

version 4.3d [9/2/97]
	prman plugin: now compatible with prman3.7 slo files [SGI vers only]

version 4.3c [8/29/97]
	prman plugin: fixed bug which causes ox to crash if it
		can't find any rendermn.ini (e.g. when RMANTREE is undef'd)

	ogre: colors drawn are clamped value-wise to user-settable range.
              this makes dark objects visible on black background.

	ogre: improved html docs
	ogre: help menu: added item to bring up HTML docs in netscape
	increased interpreter hash table size and argument stack depth
	increased error checking for write failures during rib generation
	fixed bug where temp rib files for shadow maps were not removed 
		during rendering of animation sequence
	renderman render packages (prman, bmrt, rib) changed
		generated rib file is no longer stored in "tmp.rib" --
		it's now stored in unique unix tempname unless explicitly
		set with 'ribfile parameter. If ribfile is explicitly set,
		ribfile is not automatically removed. 'remove-ribfile
		option has been removed.
	surface-override option added to prman,bmrt,rib render packages.

version 4.3 [1/23/97]

	new ogre - the interface, hopefully, has been improved. some
		functionality added
		- ability to modify camera parameters using keyboard
		  through camera settings dialog
		- points-polygons prim can use smooth normals when
		  provided 
		- (ogre) returns object which user can send messages
		  to control all major features available through 
		  interface [e.g. (define x (ogre)) (send x 'view-all)]

version 4.2c [12/19/96]

	fixed bug in bmrt query-shader which could result in file 
		not being properly closed
	added support for many motif convenience routines
		(XmCreate...) 

version 4.2b [12/4/96] (summary of major changes from v3.3 [4/3/96]) 

	new "ogre" plugin: replacement for icam tool 
	automatic motion blur
	more time efficient generation of RIB files
	light camera gop
	fixed bugs relating to DET plugin
	numerous garbage collection bugs fixed
	new OpenGL plugin: scheme interface to OpenGL (partially
		implemented)
