KNOWN BUGS
==========

Ogre 
------------
- Linux. Ogre uses private color map on Linux systems. If mouse is not 
in the ogre window, colors will appear incorrectly. In the worst case, the
ogre window may actually appear blank.

- Transform gop does not work properly when viewing the scene with
a built-in camera. However, it does works for model cameras.

PRMan render package: shadow lights
-----------------------------------
Feature? Invalid args passed to shadow lights are ignored silently.


Reading AL Types from String [10/96]
------------------------------------
The following code results in an error.

	(define p (open-input-string "#<1 2 3>"))
	(read p)

Bug in math type reader or possibly in Elk. This bug occurs for
all AL math types. This bug rears its head most often when someone 
trys to send a message to ox using something like: 

	> oxmsg "(print #<1 2>)"

Other
-----
- Linux motif bug. Text widget will pass Null call data (i.e. event info) to
