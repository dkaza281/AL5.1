WHAT IS AL?
-----------

AL (Animation Language) is a Scheme-based programming language for 
modeling and animation. It was designed primarily for use with 
RenderMan(R) renderers but can generate output for other renderers 
as well. AL also includes a set of software tools which enable 
you to write and use AL programs.

AL was developed for research and educational purposes by me
(Steve May, smay@cgrg.ohio-state.edu) at the Advanced Computing Center
for the Arts and Design at The Ohio State University. This software
is EXPERIMENTAL and is provided AS-IS with no warranties. You may do with 
it as you like but do not distribute this from other ftp or web sites 
please. Additionally, as experimental software, I reserve the right to 
change AL in the future. I will make an effort however to provide 
backwards compatibility when possible. Please send any 
suggestions/comments/bug reports to me at smay@pixar.com.

Source code is not currently distributed.

Documentation for AL can be found at the "official" AL web site
(above) or in the 'html' directory where AL is installed.


SUPPORTED PLATFORMS
-------------------

The AL software is available for the following platforms:
- SGI Irix5.3, mips1 (R3000 and earlier)
- SGI Irix5.3, mips2 (R4000 and later)
- SGI Irix6.x
- HPUX 9.05
- Linux ELF 

The software may become available for other platforms in the
future, but I will make absolutely no promises.


SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
---------------------
- Perl*. AL is not based on Perl, but it does use Perl to run 
  a couple of small scripts.
  If you do not have Perl, it can be ftp'd from ftp.uu.net or 
  archive.cis.ohio-state.edu among other places.
- X11 libraries (optional) - for Xt/Motif plugin 
- Motif** 1.2 or 2.0 libraries (optional) - for Xt/Motif plugin 
- OpenGL** libs (optional) - for GL plugin
- PhotoRealistic RenderMan (optional) - for use with prman plugin
- BMRT (optional) - for use with bmrt plugin
- On SGIs only, the Development Option is needed because the linker
  (/usr/bin/ld) is required 

 *On most platforms, perl is expected to be found in /bin. On Linux 
  machines, it is expected in /usr/bin. If Perl is not installed
  there, you will need to edit the first line of 'ox', 'ribinc', and
  'blurfold' in $ALHOME/bin to to reflect where Perl is 
  installed on your system.

 **Motif and OpenGL libraries are not required for the Linux version.
   These libraries are statically linked into the interpreter modules.

INSTALLING AL ON YOUR SYSTEM
----------------------------
0. A note about "environment variables." A number of environment
variables are mentioned below.  If you are using the "csh" UNIX shell,
the values of these variables are set using the "setenv" command. Ex:

	setenv VARNAME value

To have these variables set automatically each time your start a
shell, you should add the setenv commands to the ".cshrc" file located
in your home area. (Note that a different procedure is used for other
UNIX shells such as ksh.)

1. Copy the distribution into the intended installation directory. 

[If you are working with the source code distribution (NOT PUBLICLY
AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME), see COMPILE for instructions on compiling 
and installing the software.]

2. The 'ALHOME' environment variable should be set to the directory
where the software distribution is installed:

	setenv ALHOME /usr/local/AL

3. Add $ALHOME/bin to your PATH.

4. On SGIs, Linux, add $ALHOME/lib to the 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH'
path environment variable:

        setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $ALHOME/lib

   On HPs, add $ALHOME/lib to SHLIB_PATH:

        setenv SHLIB_PATH $ALHOME/lib


5. Add $ALHOME/lib/app-defaults/%N to the XUSERFILESEARCHPATH
path environment variable.

        setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $ALHOME/lib/app-defaults/%N

If everything gets installed, you should be able to run ox. You should
see something like (varies depending on installation):

	% ox
	Welcome to OX, version 5.0 [6/30/98]
	[BMRT][PhotoRealistic RenderMan]
	ox -->

To run the "standalone", non-windows version of AL which is smaller
and does not require an X server, use the "-m lite" flag. (Interactive
programs like "ogre" which require X will not run in this mode.)

	% ox -m lite

You may want to edit $ALHOME/etc/ox.ini to change the system-wide
default parameters for the interpreter (ox). This includes the plugins 
which are loaded and the default rendering packages. 
See the AL web page for information on this configuration file.


ADDITIONAL INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
------------------------------------
1. If you are using the PhotoRealistic RenderMan plugin, the
RMANTREE environment variable should be set to the prman installation
directory so that shaders can be properly queried.

2. If you are using the BMRT plugin, the SHADERS path environment
variable should be set to the location of BMRT shaders so that shaders
can be properly queried.

3. If Perl is not installed in /bin (/usr/bin for Linux), you'll need
to modify the first line of 'ox,' 'ribinc,' and 'blurfold' in the
'$ALHOME/bin' directory.

TROUBLE SHOOTING
----------------
- If you get "ox: Command not found" and ox is in your PATH, it may be
  that it's looking for Perl in the wrong place. Determine where Perl
  is installed and use the full pathname in the first line of the 
  ox, ribinc, and blurfold Perl scripts in the $ALHOME/bin directory.

- If the system linker fails when dynamically loading modules into ox,
  check these things:

  + Make sure at least 1M of disk space is available in /tmp or set
    TMPDIR to a directory with that much space for the linker files
    (lda*).

  + On SGIs, the current working directory must be writable by you. The 
    linker writes a file called "so_locations" in the cwd.

  + 'ox -v load' will print linker instructions and messages
